This project is a responsive landing page for a mock dog walking service. It was created to practice HTML, CSS, and DOM manipulation in JavaScript.

## Overview

- **Navigation Bar:** The website features a navigation bar with links to different sections of the page, including Home, About, Reviews, Pricing, and Contact.

- **Interactive Buttons:** Although the buttons labeled "Learn More," "Book," and "Send" are provided, they are currently non-functional and serve as design elements.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Usage

To view the landing page, simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. You can also deploy it to a web hosting service to make it accessible online.

## Acknowledgments
